# Thought Process
I documented a brainstorming process I had [here](https://github.com/KuroFoxCoder/4.1-Input-Output/blob/main/io%20thought%20process.drawio). 
# Challenges
Learning how to use a Scanner to read files posed a bit of a challenge to me. I first thought I could just make it grab the file, but then it turned out, I needed to use a "try/catch" block, which I can describe as trying something with the possibility of failure. The program tries to get the file, and if it can't find it, it fails, and I have to catch the exception it throws at me. I later had look through the Java documentation for a String, since the assignment me finding and replacing parts of Strings. Once I found that contains() and replace() existed, it was at that point in my brainstorming process that I decided that I'd repeat the task of making a class that does something, and having the process of replacing text happen in the class instead of in main(). In all honesty, I had a lot of fun doing most of my work in thinking while eating lunch.
